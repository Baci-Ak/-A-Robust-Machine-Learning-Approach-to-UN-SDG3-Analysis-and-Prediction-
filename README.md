## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3), which aims to ensure good health and well-being for all. By employing a data-driven approach, this research seeks to identify patterns and trends that can inform policy decisions and interventions aimed at achieving SDG3 targets.

### Project Structure

- **Data Sources**: Utilizes data from the UN SDG repository and the World Bank Data Hub, focusing on indicators relevant to SDG3.
- **Methodology**: Employs machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data, develop predictive models, and assess model performance.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, scikit-learn for machine learning, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for visualization.

### Repository Contents

1. **Goal3_main.xlsx** - Main dataset containing aggregated SDG3 progress indicators.
2. **formatted_data.csv** - Preprocessed and formatted dataset ready for analysis.
3. **formatted_data.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook detailing the data formatting process.
4. **pre_processing.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook illustrating the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset.
5. **EDA.ipynb** - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook showcasing initial data exploration and insights.
6. **model_development.ipynb** - Notebook documenting the development and evaluation of machine learning models for SDG3 progress prediction.
7. **SDG3_data.csv** - Raw dataset obtained from the UN SDG repository.
8. **SDG3_Standardized_data.csv** - Dataset containing standardized values of SDG3 indicators for model training.

### Research Findings
- **Key Indicators Analysis**: Identified critical health indicators that significantly impact SDG3 progress, including maternal mortality, under-5 mortality, and access to healthcare services.
- **Model Performance**: The Random Forest model outperformed other algorithms in predicting SDG3 progress, with high accuracy and insight into feature importance.
- **Regional Disparities**: Highlighted variations in SDG3 achievements across different regions, underscoring the need for targeted interventions in areas lagging behind.

### Applications and Implications
- **Policy Guidance**: Provides evidence-based insights to guide policymakers in resource allocation and intervention planning.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Offers a robust framework for monitoring SDG3 progress and evaluating the impact of health initiatives.
- **Future Research**: Lays the groundwork for further studies exploring the integration of additional indicators and the use of advanced machine learning techniques.
